# Navigation & Dead End Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Logout Blank Screen** ✅
**Problem:** When users clicked logout, the app showed a blank screen instead of redirecting to the login page.

**Root Cause:**
- The "Account" button in BottomNav was directly calling `logout()` instead of navigating to an Account screen
- After logout, `user` became `null` but there was no proper Account screen component

**Solution:**
- Created new [AccountScreen.tsx](components/AccountScreen.tsx) component with:
  - User profile information display
  - Proper logout button with confirmation dialog
  - App version info
  - Clean, modern design matching the app theme
- Updated [BottomNav.tsx](components/BottomNav.tsx) to navigate to the Account screen instead of logging out directly
- Updated [App.tsx](App.tsx) to render the AccountScreen component

**Files Modified:**
- [components/AccountScreen.tsx](components/AccountScreen.tsx) - NEW FILE
- [components/BottomNav.tsx](components/BottomNav.tsx) - Fixed button behavior
- [App.tsx](App.tsx) - Added AccountScreen import and rendering

### 2. **Kitchen Display System - No Logout for Staff** ✅
**Problem:** Staff users viewing the Kitchen Display had no way to logout.

**Solution:**
- Added logout button to the Kitchen Display header
- Red logout button positioned next to "View Archive" and "Back to Admin" buttons
- Imported `useAuth` hook to access logout functionality

**Files Modified:**
- [components/admin/KitchenDisplaySystem.tsx](components/admin/KitchenDisplaySystem.tsx) - Added logout button

---

### 3. **No Quick Way to Return to Menu** ✅
**Problem:** Users on Order or Account screens had no quick way to return to the Menu without using bottom navigation.

**Solution:**
- Made the header title "☕ The Daily Grind" clickable to return to menu
- Added hover effect and pointer cursor
- Added tap animation for better UX feedback
- Works consistently across all customer screens

**Files Modified:**
- [components/Header.tsx](components/Header.tsx) - Made title clickable with `onTitleClick` prop
- [App.tsx](App.tsx) - Passed callback to set active screen to 'menu'
