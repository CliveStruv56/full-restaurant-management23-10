name: Backend Queries
description: Write secure, efficient database queries using parameterized statements, eager loading to prevent N+1 problems, and proper indexing strategies. Use this skill when writing database queries, fetching data from the database, or optimizing query performance. When implementing data retrieval logic, joins, or complex query operations. When working with ORM query builders, raw SQL, or database access layers. When optimizing queries to avoid N+1 problems or performance issues. When implementing transactions, caching strategies, or query timeouts.

## When to use this skill:

- When writing database queries using ORM methods or query builders
- When fetching data from the database in controllers, services, or repositories
- When implementing complex queries with joins or aggregations
- When optimizing queries to prevent N+1 query problems
- When using eager loading or includes to fetch related data
- When implementing database transactions for related operations
- When adding query timeouts or performance optimizations
- When caching expensive or frequently-run queries
- When working with files that contain data access logic (repositories/, queries/, services/)
