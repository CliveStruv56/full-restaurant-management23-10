name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write minimal, strategic tests focused on core user flows and critical paths during development, deferring comprehensive testing until logical completion points. Use this skill when adding tests for new features, writing unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests. When testing critical business logic and primary user workflows. When working with test files (.test.js, .spec.ts, __tests__/), test frameworks (Jest, RSpec, pytest), or mocking external dependencies. When deciding what to test and when to test it during the development process.

## When to use this skill:

- When writing tests at logical feature completion points
- When working with test files (.test.js, .spec.ts, .test.tsx, __tests__/)
- When testing core user flows and critical business paths
- When writing unit tests that focus on behavior, not implementation
- When mocking external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems)
- When creating clear, descriptive test names
- When ensuring tests execute quickly for frequent developer feedback
- When deciding whether to write tests now or defer until later
- When balancing test coverage with development velocity
