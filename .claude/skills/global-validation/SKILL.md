description: Validate input data on both server and client side using allowlists, type checking, format validation, and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities. Use this skill when implementing form validation, API input validation, or data sanitization. When checking data types, formats, ranges, and required fields. When writing validation logic for user input, API requests, or business rules. When implementing both client-side validation for UX and server-side validation for security. This skill applies to all input validation across the entire project.
