name: Global Error Handling
description: Implement robust error handling with user-friendly messages, specific exception types, centralized error boundaries, and graceful degradation. Use this skill when adding try-catch blocks, throwing exceptions, or handling errors. When implementing error boundaries, retry logic, or fallback behaviors. When validating input and failing fast with clear error messages. When working with error handling middleware, exception classes, or error logging. This skill applies to all code that deals with errors, failures, or exceptional conditions across the entire project.

## When to use this skill:

- When adding error handling logic with try-catch or equivalent mechanisms
- When throwing or raising exceptions in any code
- When implementing centralized error handling (error boundaries, middleware)
- When writing user-facing error messages or validation feedback
- When implementing retry strategies for external service calls
- When ensuring resources are cleaned up in finally blocks
- When designing graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- When validating input and failing fast with clear errors
- This skill applies to all error handling across the entire project
