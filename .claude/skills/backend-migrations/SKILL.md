description: Create and manage database migrations with reversible changes, clear naming conventions, and zero-downtime deployment strategies. Use this skill when creating database schema changes, adding or modifying tables, columns, or indexes. When writing migration files to alter database structure. When implementing rollback methods for safe migration reversals. When working with migration files (migrations/, db/migrate/, schema changes) or ORM migration tools. When planning database schema evolution and handling backwards compatibility during deployments.
