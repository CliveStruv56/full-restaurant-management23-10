## 3. Roadmap Updates

**Status:** ⚠️ Needs Update

### Current Roadmap Status
In `agent-os/product/roadmap.md`, Item #2 is currently marked as:
```markdown
2. [ ] User Invitation System - Cloud Functions-based invitation flow... `L`
```

### Required Update
This item should be marked as **IN PROGRESS** or **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**, since:
- All code implementation is complete (Phases 1-4)
- Only deployment and testing remain (Phase 5)

### Recommended Roadmap Update
```markdown
2. [~] User Invitation System - Cloud Functions-based invitation flow where tenant admins can invite staff and customers via email. Invited users receive temporary credentials, set their password, and are automatically assigned to the correct tenant with appropriate role permissions. **STATUS: Implementation complete, pending staging deployment and Mailgun setup** `L`
```

Or, if using a checkbox format:
```markdown
2. [x] User Invitation System (Implementation Complete - Pending Deployment)
```

### Notes
The roadmap uses a simple checkbox format. Since implementation is complete but deployment is pending, the checkbox state depends on the team's definition:
- If checkbox means "implementation complete" → Mark as [x]
- If checkbox means "production ready" → Keep as [ ] or use [~] for in-progress
- Recommend adding a status note to clarify deployment dependency

```

### Test Files Present
The following test files exist but were not executed:
- `functions/src/invitations/__tests__/createInvitation.test.ts`
- `functions/src/invitations/__tests__/acceptInvitation.test.ts`

### Manual Testing Documentation
Instead of automated tests, the implementation includes:
- **60+ manual test scenarios** documented in `INVITATION_SYSTEM_TEST_PLAN.md`
- **10 test categories** covering all functionality
- **Step-by-step test procedures** with expected results

### Failed Tests
**None** - No tests were executed.

### Notes
**Why No Automated Tests:**
1. Project does not have a test framework configured (no Jest, Mocha, or Vitest setup)
2. `npm test` script is not defined in package.json
3. Cloud Functions package.json also lacks test script
4. Test files exist but appear to be templates/stubs

**Recommendations:**
1. Configure Jest or Vitest test framework
2. Add test scripts to package.json files
3. Execute unit tests for Cloud Functions before deployment
4. Consider adding integration tests for critical flows
5. Run Firebase Emulator tests for security rules

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Medium Risk** - Code builds successfully but lacks automated test coverage
- Manual testing on staging environment is critical before production
- Security rules must be tested with Firebase Emulator
- Email delivery must be tested with real Mailgun account
