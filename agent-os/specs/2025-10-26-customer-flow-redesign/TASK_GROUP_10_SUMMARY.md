- ✅ `react-datepicker` - Date picker in ReservationForm (already installed)

---

## Real-Time Features

### Firestore Snapshots
- ReservationManager uses `onSnapshot` via `streamReservations()`
- Updates propagate in < 2 seconds
- No manual refresh required
- Multiple admin windows stay synchronized

### Filter Behavior
- Filters applied at Firestore query level (efficient)
- Real-time updates respect active filters
- Clear Filters button restores full list

---

## User Experience Highlights

### Customer Journey
1. Land on landing page
2. Click "Book for Later"
3. Fill reservation form (Task Group 9)
4. **NEW:** See confirmation screen with all details
5. **NEW:** Option to go back home or order now
6. **NEW:** Reservation appears in admin panel immediately

### Admin Experience

---

## Next Steps

### Task Group 11: Auto-Cancellation Cloud Function
**Dependencies Met:** Task Group 10 complete
**Ready for Implementation:** Yes

**What's Next:**
- Scheduled Cloud Function to auto-cancel no-shows
- Runs every 5 minutes
- Checks reservations >15 minutes past booking time
- Updates status to 'no-show' automatically
- Adds admin notes with timestamp

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No Confirmation Dialog for Cancel**
   - Cancel button immediately updates status
   - Could add confirmation modal in future

2. **No Undo Functionality**
   - Status updates are permanent
   - Admin must manually correct mistakes

3. **No Reservation Editing**
   - Customers cannot edit after submission
   - Admin can only update status and notes
   - Full editing could be added in future

4. **No Email/SMS Notifications**
   - Status changes don't notify customer
   - Out of scope for Phase 3 (deferred to Phase 4+)

---

## Performance Notes

### Build Performance

### Data Validation
- Client-side validation in ReservationForm
- Server-side validation in Firestore rules
- Admin notes have no character limit (intentional)
- Status transitions not validated (admin has full control)

---
