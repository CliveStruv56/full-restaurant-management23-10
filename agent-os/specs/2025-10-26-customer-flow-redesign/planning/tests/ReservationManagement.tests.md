## Integration Testing

### End-to-End Reservation Flow

**Test Scenario:** Customer creates reservation → Admin confirms → Customer arrives → Order complete

**Steps:**
1. Customer: Navigate to landing page
2. Customer: Click "Book for Later"
3. Customer: Fill reservation form (tomorrow, 7:00 PM, 4 people)
4. Customer: Submit form
5. Customer: See confirmation screen
6. Admin: Log in, navigate to Reservations
7. Admin: See new pending reservation
8. Admin: Click Confirm
9. Admin: Add admin notes: "Requested quiet corner"
10. Customer: Arrive at restaurant tomorrow
11. Admin: Click Seat button
12. Customer: Complete meal
13. Admin: Click Complete button

**Expected Behavior:**
- Customer sees reservation immediately after submission
- Admin sees reservation in real-time (no refresh needed)
- Status transitions work smoothly
- Admin notes save and persist
- Final status is "completed"

---

## Performance Testing

### Real-Time Updates

**Test:**
1. Open ReservationManager in two browser windows (same admin account)
2. Create new reservation in Window 1
3. Verify it appears in Window 2 without refresh
4. Update status in Window 1
5. Verify status updates in Window 2

**Expected:** Real-time sync < 2 seconds

---

## Accessibility Testing

### Keyboard Navigation

**Test:**
1. Navigate to ReservationManager
2. Use Tab key to navigate through filters
3. Use Enter to open details modal
4. Use Tab to navigate modal fields
5. Use Escape to close modal

**Expected:** All interactive elements accessible via keyboard

---

## Edge Cases

### No Reservations

**Test:** Navigate to ReservationManager with no reservations
**Expected:** Empty state message: "No reservations found"

### No Tables Configured

**Test:** Access ReservationForm when `settings.availableTables` is empty
**Expected:** Table preference dropdown shows only "No Preference"

### Filter with No Results

**Test:** Apply date filter for date with no reservations
**Expected:** Empty state + "Try adjusting your filters" message

## Future Automation

When test infrastructure is added:

```typescript
// Example test with React Testing Library
import { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { ReservationManager } from './ReservationManager';
import { streamReservations } from '../firebase/api-multitenant';

jest.mock('../firebase/api-multitenant');

describe('ReservationManager', () => {
  it('should list reservations', async () => {
    const mockReservations = [
      { id: '1', contactName: 'John Doe', status: 'pending', ... },
      { id: '2', contactName: 'Jane Smith', status: 'confirmed', ... },
    ];

    (streamReservations as jest.Mock).mockImplementation((tenantId, filters, callback) => {
      callback(mockReservations);
      return jest.fn(); // unsubscribe function
    });

    render(<ReservationManager />);

    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(screen.getByText('Jane Smith')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });

  it('should filter by status', async () => {
    // Test implementation...
  });

  // More tests...
});
```
