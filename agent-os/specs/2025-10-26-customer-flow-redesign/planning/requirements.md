```

**Technical Notes:**
- Landing page data stored in `tenants/{tenantId}/settings` document
- Images stored in Firebase Storage: `tenants/{tenantId}/branding/logo.png`, `hero.jpg`
- Use React component: `components/LandingPage.tsx`
- Mobile-responsive design (critical for mobile ordering)

---

### 2. Order Type Selection Flow

**Requirement:** After landing page, customers choose their ordering intent.

**Flow Option A (Selected):**
```
Landing Page
    ‚Üì
"Are you here now or want to book for later?"
    ‚îú‚îÄ "I'm here now / Arriving soon"
    ‚îÇ     ‚Üì
    ‚îÇ  "Eat In or Take Away?"
    ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ Eat In ‚Üí [Menu with dine-in items]
    ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ Take Away ‚Üí [Menu with takeaway items]
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ "Book for Later"
           ‚Üì
       Reservation Form
           ‚Üì
       [Confirmation - No immediate ordering]
```

**UI Components:**
1. **Intent Selection Screen:**
   - Two large, friendly buttons:
     - "I'm Here Now / Arriving Soon" (e.g., green, inviting)
     - "Book for Later" (e.g., blue, calendar icon)
   - Clear, concise copy
   - Skip this screen if arrived via QR code (go straight to menu)

2. **Order Type Selection Screen (for "here now" flow):**
   - Two toggle buttons:
     - "Eat In" (üçΩÔ∏è icon)
     - "Take Away" (üì¶ icon)
   - Contextual message: "Will you be dining with us or taking away?"
   - Skip this screen if arrived via QR code with table number (auto-select "Eat In")

**State Management:**
- Store customer intent in React state: `customerIntent: 'now' | 'later' | null`
- Store order type in state: `orderType: 'dine-in' | 'takeaway' | null`
- Pass to menu and cart components

---

### 3. QR Code Table Ordering System

**Requirement:** Each table has a unique QR code that bypasses landing page and pre-fills context.

**QR Code Generation:**
- Admin generates QR codes from admin panel
- Each QR encodes URL: `https://{tenant}.orderflow.app/order?table={tableNumber}`
- QR codes can be:
  - Downloaded as PNG images for printing
  - Printed on table tents/stands
  - Displayed on laminated cards

**QR Code Flow:**
```
Customer scans QR code
    ‚Üì
App opens with table number pre-filled
    ‚Üì
Skips landing page
    ‚Üì
Skips intent selection (assumes "here now")
    ‚Üì
Skips order type (auto-selects "Eat In")
    ‚Üì
Goes directly to Menu with:
    - orderType = 'dine-in'
    - tableNumber = {from QR}
    - Shows dine-in menu items only
```

**Admin QR Management:**
- New "QR Codes" section in admin panel
- Shows list of tables with "Download QR Code" button for each
- Optionally: Bulk download all QR codes as ZIP
- Preview QR code before download

**Technical Implementation:**
- Use `qrcode.react` library for QR generation
- Route: `/order?table=X` detected in App.tsx
- Parse table number from URL query params
- Auto-populate order context state
- Skip navigation screens if table param present

---

### 4. Reservation System

**Requirement:** Customers can book a table for future date/time without ordering immediately.

**Reservation Form Fields:**
1. **Date** (required)
   - Date picker (future dates only, no past dates)
   - Respect restaurant operating hours and service periods

2. **Time** (required)
   - Time slot dropdown (15-minute intervals)
   - Generated based on service period settings (lunch, dinner)
   - Show available slots only

3. **Party Size** (required)
   - Number input (min: 1, max: configurable, default: 20)
   - Affects table availability calculation (future enhancement)

4. **Contact Details** (required)
   - Name (text input)
   - Phone number (tel input with validation)
   - Email (email input with validation)

5. **Table Preference** (optional)
   - Dropdown of available table numbers or "No Preference"
   - Note: "We'll do our best to accommodate your preference"

6. **Special Requests** (optional)
   - Textarea (max 500 chars)
   - Examples: "Window seat please", "Celebrating anniversary", "High chair needed"

**Reservation Flow:**
```
Customer selects "Book for Later"
    ‚Üì
Fills reservation form
    ‚Üì
Submits reservation
    ‚Üì
Backend creates reservation document
    ‚Üì
Confirmation screen with details
    ‚Üì
(Optional) Confirmation email sent
    ‚Üì
Customer arrives at restaurant
    ‚Üì
Staff checks reservation in admin panel
    ‚Üì
Customer orders at table (via QR or in-person)
```

**Important:** Reservations do NOT include pre-ordering. Customers order when they arrive.

**Reservation Status Workflow:**
- `pending` - Just created, awaiting staff confirmation
- `confirmed` - Staff confirmed the reservation
- `seated` - Customer arrived and seated
- `completed` - Service finished
- `cancelled` - Cancelled by customer or auto-cancelled
- `no-show` - Customer didn't arrive

**Auto-Cancellation Rules:**
- If customer doesn't arrive within 15 minutes of reservation time, status ‚Üí `no-show`
- Automated via scheduled Cloud Function (runs every 5 minutes)

**Data Model:**
```typescript
interface Reservation {
  id: string;
  tenantId: string;
  date: string; // YYYY-MM-DD
  time: string; // HH:mm (24-hour)
  partySize: number;
  contactName: string;
  contactPhone: string;
  contactEmail: string;
  tablePreference?: number;
  specialRequests?: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'seated' | 'completed' | 'cancelled' | 'no-show';
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

**Admin Management:**
- View list of reservations (filterable by date, status)
- Manually confirm/cancel reservations
- See contact details and special requests
- Mark as seated when customer arrives
- Mark as completed when service finished

---

### 5. Menu Differentiation by Order Type

**Requirement:** Different products available for dine-in vs. takeaway.

**Product Configuration:**
- Each product has new field: `availableFor: ('dine-in' | 'takeaway' | 'both')[]`
- Admin sets this when creating/editing products in ProductManager
- Default: `['both']` (available for all order types)

**Examples:**
- Coffee to-go with disposable cup: `['takeaway']`
- Dine-in ceramic mug coffee: `['dine-in']`
- Pastries: `['both']`
- Hot soup (not suitable for takeaway): `['dine-in']`

**Menu Filtering Logic:**
```typescript
const filteredProducts = products.filter(product => {
  if (!product.availableFor) return true; // Backward compatibility
  return product.availableFor.includes(currentOrderType);
});
```

**UI Updates:**
- ProductManager shows "Available For" field with checkboxes:
  - ‚òëÔ∏è Dine-In
  - ‚òëÔ∏è Takeaway
- Customer menu only shows products matching their selected order type
- If order type changes (unlikely but possible), menu re-filters

**Database Schema Update:**
```typescript
interface Product {
  // ... existing fields
  availableFor?: ('dine-in' | 'takeaway' | 'both')[];
}
```

### 6. Phase Scope and Priorities

**Requirement:** Focus on customer-facing flow first. Save complex admin features for later.

**IN SCOPE for Phase 3 (Customer Flow Redesign):**
- ‚úÖ Landing page with branding
- ‚úÖ Intent selection (now vs. later)
- ‚úÖ Order type selection (eat in vs. takeaway)
- ‚úÖ QR code generation and routing
- ‚úÖ Reservation form and submission
- ‚úÖ Admin reservation viewing
- ‚úÖ Menu filtering by order type
- ‚úÖ Product availability configuration
- ‚úÖ Auto-cancellation of no-shows
- ‚úÖ Guest checkout (no forced login)

**OUT OF SCOPE for Phase 3 (Deferred to Future):**
- ‚ùå Visual floor plan builder
- ‚ùå Smart table assignment algorithm
- ‚ùå Real-time table availability checking
- ‚ùå Table occupation status tracking (occupied, available, reserved)
- ‚ùå Drag-and-drop table editor
- ‚ùå Automatic table merging for large parties
- ‚ùå Waitlist management
- ‚ùå SMS reservation reminders (Twilio integration)
- ‚ùå Email reservation confirmations (SendGrid integration)

**Rationale:**
- Customer flow improvements provide immediate value
- Reservation system gets restaurants started quickly
- Advanced table management can be Phase 4+ based on feedback
- Avoid scope creep and over-engineering

---

### 7. Walk-In vs. Reservation Priority

**Requirement:** Simple rules for managing walk-ins and reservations without complex availability checks.

**Walk-In Handling:**
- **No real-time availability check** for walk-ins
- Customers who select "I'm here now" can always proceed to menu
- Staff manually manages table seating in the real world
- System assumes restaurant can accommodate walk-ins
- If full, staff communicates wait times in person

**Reservation Rules:**
- **15-Minute Grace Period:** Reservations auto-cancel if customer doesn't arrive within 15 mins of booking time
- Scheduled Cloud Function runs every 5 minutes:
  ```typescript
  // Pseudo-code
  const now = new Date();
  const reservations = await getReservations({ status: 'confirmed' });

  for (const res of reservations) {
    const reservationDateTime = new Date(`${res.date} ${res.time}`);
    const minutesPast = (now - reservationDateTime) / 60000;

    if (minutesPast > 15) {
      await updateReservation(res.id, { status: 'no-show' });
    }
  }
  ```

**Table Occupation Settings:**
- Admin configures "typical table occupation time" by service period and party size
- **Service Periods:**
  - Breakfast: 45 minutes
  - Lunch: 60 minutes
  - Dinner: 90 minutes
- **Party Size Modifiers:**
  - Solo (1 person): -15 minutes
  - Couple (2 people): base time
  - Small group (3-4): +15 minutes
  - Large group (5+): +30 minutes

**Example Calculation:**
- Dinner reservation for 5 people
- Base dinner time: 90 minutes
- Large group modifier: +30 minutes
- Expected occupation: 120 minutes (2 hours)

**Configuration UI:**
- New section in SettingsManager: "Table Occupation Times"
- Input fields for each service period
- Party size modifiers table
- Used for future availability calculations (Phase 4+)

**Phase 3 Implementation:**
- Store settings in Firestore
- **Do NOT** use for real-time availability yet
- Foundation for Phase 4 smart availability algorithm

---

### 8. Authentication Flow

**Requirement:** Flexible authentication that doesn't interrupt the ordering experience.

**Philosophy:** "Guest-first, account-optional"

**Guest Checkout:**
- Customers can complete entire order flow without creating account
- Required info captured in order form:
  - Name (for order identification)
  - Phone (for pickup notification)
  - Email (optional, for receipt)
- Order saved with `guestEmail` and `guestPhone` fields
- No password, no account, no friction

**Optional Account Creation:**
- **When:** After first order placement
- **Where:** Post-order confirmation screen
- **Prompt:** "Want to track your order and earn rewards? Create a free account!"
- **Benefits highlighted:**
  - Order history
  - Loyalty points
  - Faster checkout next time
  - Reservation management
- **Action:** "Create Account" button (optional, skippable)

**Account Creation Flow:**
```
Order placed as guest
    ‚Üì
Confirmation screen shows
    ‚Üì
[Optional] "Create Account" button
    ‚Üì
If clicked:
    - Email already captured from order
    - Ask for password
    - Create Firebase Auth user
    - Link guest order to new user account
    ‚Üì
Account created, user logged in
```

**Returning Customers:**
- **If logged in:** Name/email pre-filled, loyalty points visible
- **If guest:** Normal guest flow, option to "Sign In" in top nav

**Sign In / Sign Up Location:**
- Small "Sign In" link in header navigation
- Does NOT block ordering flow
- Separate screens for sign in and sign up
- Social auth supported (Google, Facebook) via Firebase Auth

**Technical Notes:**
- Use Firebase Anonymous Auth for guest checkout
- Upgrade anonymous user to permanent account when they sign up
- Link orders via `userId` field (null for guests, populated for accounts)
- Guest orders stored with `guestEmail` and `guestPhone` for tracking
